## 2. Critical Metrics Amazon Sellers Need

### 2.1 Top 10 Most Important KPIs

Based on 2025 seller surveys and tool analysis, here are the essential metrics:

#### 1. **Net Profit & Net Profit Margin** (PRIORITY #1)
- **Formula:** `(Total Revenue - All Expenses) / Total Revenue × 100`
- **Target:** 15-20% minimum, 20-30% for successful sellers
- **Why Critical:** Only metric that shows true business health
- **Calculation Requirements:**
  - Revenue from all sources
  - Amazon referral fees (8-45%, avg 15%)
  - FBA fulfillment fees
  - Storage fees (standard & oversize)
  - PPC costs
  - COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
  - Returns & refunds (including damaged goods)
  - 70+ "hidden" Amazon fees
  - Shipping costs (inbound & outbound)

#### 2. **Gross Profit**
- **Formula:** `Total Revenue - COGS - Amazon Fees`
- **Why Important:** Shows profitability before operating expenses
- **Use Case:** Quick product viability assessment

#### 3. **Sales Revenue & Sales Velocity**
- **Total Sales:** Revenue from all product sales over period
- **Sales Velocity:** `Units Sold / Average Inventory Level`
- **Why Critical:**
  - Measures inventory efficiency
  - Impacts IPI score (Inventory Performance Index)
  - Affects storage fees and capacity limits

#### 4. **ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)**
- **Formula:** `Ad Spend / Ad Revenue × 100`
- **Target:** Below break-even ACOS for profitability
- **Why Critical:** Measures PPC campaign efficiency
- **Insight:** Lower ACOS = more efficient advertising

#### 5. **TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales)**
- **Formula:** `Ad Spend / Total Revenue (Organic + Paid) × 100`
- **Why Important:** Shows true advertising impact on business
- **Trend:** Decreasing TACOS = growing organic sales, building brand
- **Use Case:** Long-term growth measurement vs. ACOS for campaigns

#### 6. **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- **Formula:** `Ad Sales / Ad Spend`
- **Average:** 3x on Amazon
- **Why Critical:** Inverse of ACOS - easier to understand ROI
- **Example:** ROAS of 4 = $4 revenue for every $1 spent

#### 7. **Conversion Rate**
- **Formula:** `Orders / Sessions × 100`
- **Why Critical:** "Arguably the most important KPI" per experts
- **Impact:** Shows listing quality, pricing effectiveness, customer confidence
- **Benchmark:** Amazon average 10-15%

#### 8. **IPI Score (Inventory Performance Index)**
- **Range:** 0-1000
- **Target:** 450+ to avoid restrictions
- **Components:**
  - Excess inventory percentage
  - FBA sell-through rate
  - Stranded inventory percentage
  - In-stock rate
- **Why Critical:** Determines FBA capacity limits
- **Impact:** Low IPI = storage restrictions, higher fees

#### 9. **BSR (Best Seller Rank)**
- **What It Is:** Product's sales rank vs. similar products in category
- **Updates:** Hourly
- **Why Critical:**
  - Sales performance indicator (lower = better)
  - Competitive benchmarking
  - Early warning for issues
  - Product research for new opportunities
- **Problem:** Amazon doesn't provide historical data
- **Solution:** Third-party tools must track BSR history

#### 10. **ODR (Order Defect Rate)**
- **Formula:** `(Negative feedback + A-to-Z claims + Chargebacks) / Total Orders × 100`
- **Target:** Under 1%
- **Why Critical:** Affects account health and Buy Box eligibility
- **Components:**
  - Negative feedback
  - A-to-Z Guarantee claims
  - Chargebacks

---

4. **Last 30 Days** - Monthly performance
5. **Last Month** - Period comparison
6. **Custom Date Ranges** - Seasonal analysis, promotion tracking

**Dashboard Design Insight:**
- Sellerboard uses 5 time-period tiles (Today → Last Month)
- Change indicators (% up/down from previous period) are essential
- Comparison vs. same period last year for seasonality

---

### 2.4 Profit Calculation Deep Dive

#### Amazon FBA Fee Structure (2025)

**Referral Fees:**
- 8-45% by category
- Most common: 15%
- No increases announced for 2025

**FBA Fulfillment Fees:**
- Based on product size/weight tier
- Small standard: ~$3.22
- Large standard: ~$5.32-$8.73
- Oversize: $10.05+

**Storage Fees (per cubic foot/month):**
- Standard (Jan-Sep): $0.78
- Standard (Oct-Dec): $2.40
- Oversize (Jan-Sep): $0.53
- Oversize (Oct-Dec): $1.40
- **Improvement:** Down from $0.87 to $0.78 off-peak (2025)

**Overage Fees:**
- $10 per cubic foot/month beyond capacity limits

**Other Fees to Account For:**
- Long-term storage fees (181+ days)
- Removal/disposal fees
- Return processing fees
- Inbound placement fees (with reductions)
- Aged inventory surcharges
- Multi-channel fulfillment fees

#### Accurate Profit Formula

```
Net Profit = Revenue
  - COGS
  - Referral Fees
  - FBA Fulfillment Fees
  - Storage Fees
  - PPC Costs
  - Returns (product value + fees)
  - Refunds
  - Promotional Discounts
  - Inbound Shipping
  - Amazon Reimbursements (add back)
```

#### Break-Even ACOS Calculation

```
Break-Even ACOS = (Selling Price - Total Costs) / Selling Price × 100

Example:
Selling Price: $30
COGS: $8
Amazon Fees: $10
Total Cost: $18
Margin: $12

Break-Even ACOS = $12 / $30 × 100 = 40%
```

**Critical Insight:** Must calculate per product as ACOS targets vary wildly

---

## 3. Amazon Seller Pain Points

### 3.1 Financial Challenges

**Cash Flow Crisis:**

## 4. Dashboard Design Best Practices

### 4.1 Layout & Organization Principles

**Screen Real Estate:**
- Limit to 5-6 cards in initial view
- Single-screen dashboard improves UX (avoid scrolling for critical data)
- Human brain processes ~7-9 items effectively - don't overwhelm

**Visual Hierarchy:**

- Progressive disclosure: overview → drill-down details

**Component Types:**
1. **Tiles/Cards:** Summary metrics with change indicators
2. **Charts:** Trend analysis and relationships
3. **Tables:** Product lists with sortable columns
4. **Maps:** Regional performance visualization

---

### 4.2 Data Visualization Best Practices

**Chart Selection:**
- **Line Charts:** Time-series data (sales trends, profit over time)

- **Area Charts:** Cumulative metrics (total revenue growth)
- **Heatmaps:** Multi-dimensional data (BSR tracking across products/time)

**Color Psychology:**
- **Green:** Positive metrics, profit, growth, success indicators
- **Red:** Negative metrics, losses, alerts, declining performance
- **Blue:** Neutral information, primary actions, trust
- **Amber/Yellow:** Warnings, attention needed, moderate priority
- **Gray:** Inactive, disabled, secondary information

**Design Standards:**
- Consistent color usage throughout dashboard
- Icons with hover animations for interactivity
- Cognitive landmarks: Show averages, targets, benchmarks for context
- Data-first approach: Visuals enhance understanding, not decorate

---

### 4.3 Interactive Elements

## Conclusion

The Amazon seller analytics market is mature but has clear gaps that SellerGenix can exploit:

1. **Real-time data** is underserved (most lag 24-48 hours)
2. **Mobile experience** is weak across competitors (desktop-first design)
3. **WhatsApp notifications** don't exist (unique opportunity)
4. **AI-powered features** are basic or missing (predictive analytics)
5. **Cash flow visibility** is absent (major pain point unaddressed)

**SellerGenix's winning formula:**
- Sellerboard-level profit accuracy
- Helium 10-level feature breadth (focused on analytics, not research)
- Jungle Scout-level beginner-friendliness
- Unique innovations: WhatsApp, AI restock, cash flow forecasting

**Path to 1,000 users:**
- Month 1-2: Build MVP

- Month 5-6: Add WhatsApp, grow to 500 users
- Month 7-12: Add AI features, scale to 2,500 users, introduce Pro tier ($79/mo)

**Financial Projection:**
- Year 1: 2,500 users × $40 ARPU × 12 months = $1.2M ARR
